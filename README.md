# Advanced CDK Training Email Course

What: Learn advanced CDK concepts under the [CDK.dev](http://cdk.dev) umbrella

How: Email workshop like the “Blogging for devs” [https://bloggingfordevs.com/](https://bloggingfordevs.com/)

Why: Gap in the available training to advanced application development with CDK

In a series of emails, we will guide you through the process of building advanced CDK apps.

This workshop is a continuation of the AWS CDK workshop. The official CDK workshop introduces and touches on a lot of topics, but it's hard to do the jump to more complex applications without pointers and ideas on what to do next.

### Scenario:

We started introducing AWS-CDK at Moonwalk inc. and are now tasked to develop and deploy a new customer-facing application consisting of a frontend and a backend.

Our first tries with the aws-cdk in *dev* were successful, but now we must adhere to company policy. That means we have to deploy the app via CI/CD pipelines, ensure security, write unit tests and deploy in DR resilient way.

### The architecture:

## Topics to cover:

- CI/CD - Cross account deployment
- Multi Stack - split app/db/pipeline stack
- (Multi Account and Region?)
- Tagging
- Testing - how to write meaningful tests
- Updating/upgrading your app to newer CDK versions / Projen?
- Everything from this page: [https://openconstructfoundation.org/cdk-helpers/](https://openconstructfoundation.org/cdk-helpers/)
- Where to find 3rd party constructs and how to use em:
    - CDKpatterns.com
    - awscdk.io
    - AWS solutions lib
- How to read the documentation and find examples like Gists on Github. (Eg: How the * do I construct an EBS volume property?)
- Env variables  and context files

## Format:

This will be a series of email that is sent out in a regular cadence every couple days. The idea is to split up this workshop in bite-size pieces that you can follow at your own pace. 
As an alternative, it can be also available in PDF format for people who dislike the format.
